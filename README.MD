# Bindo.CSS - A CSS on an Overused Meme

Binod.CSS is a CSS library based on the wildly popular and overused "Binod" meme.

## How to use this library

1. Import this CSS via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="this_link_will_be_updated_soon">`

Apply `.binod(case sensitive)` to any of your HTML element and see the magic
All the elements are in most of the cases placed centered to the page. So, it is not for any serious HTML
